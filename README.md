# Project-23
This contains the files that were edited and coded in the Project 23 in WhitehatJR Pro Course. It has a helicopter sprite that can move with the left and right arrow keys and also a package sprite that can fall on clicking down arrow with a basket sprite and a ground sprite. It is coded in javascript using "matter.js". To change the logic, edit the code in the file 'sketch.js' file.
